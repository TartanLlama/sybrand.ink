We strive to provide a selection
of products for our customers
who have certain food allergies,
follow special diets, or prefer
to be served coffee in silence
as they read over texts
they promised themselves they'd delete,
let their drink go cold and night 
grow late, sit with one glove off
as the street lights stretch
down through the diner windows
and the last order bell rings
rings rings rings rings rings
