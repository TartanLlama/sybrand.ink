I met a unicorn today  
Her hair was brown and matted  
Her horn ingrown (slightly)  
Pus wiped with a cracked hoof  
She speaks in whispers  
Her voice full of craters  
As she sits on the park swing  
Cream rubbed under the eyes  
Legs pulsing  
Her day far away  
Mine drifting to sleep  
Under a black moon
