<p>He spoke to a woman, once,
I believe it was his mother.</p>
<p>Stepping over the bar
on the floor, he spews</p>
<p>another deathfantasy,
inky fingers and squid brain,</p>
<p>Chekov's gun of a blonde;
made to be used,</p>
<p>an inevitability ofâ€”well,
electrons forced through tired synapse,</p>
<p>fire! Crime made by crime,
the blonde sits alone</p>
<p>in the bar, motionless.
&quot;Aren't all women just waiting</p>
<p>for us?&quot; he types into Reddit,
before closing the lid,</p>
<p>and going to bed,
alone.</p>
