<pre>
I: Wardrobe
Stubby cigarette holder, more bizarre
than elegant. Black dress, tight
on throat, loose on thighs, 
still pocketless. Eyeliner,
inexpertly applied, waging war
on mismatched heels.

II: Direction
Private dick scrubs with stubble, I blow
the rubbings from sandpaper,
sit there, look
human. Pretend
to exist, for now,
for him,
draw your outline against the wall
with mascara, 
Panda skirting boards,
ladder tights leading to rain-soaked roofs,
a vanilla heist. Facerip, my hand
will guide towards the blade.

III: Script
