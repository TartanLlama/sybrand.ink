He spoke to a woman, once,
I believe it was his mother.

Stepping over the bar
on the floor, he spews

another deathfantasy,
inky fingers and squid brain,

Chekov's gun of a blonde;
made to be used,

an inevitability ofâ€”well, 
electrons forced through tired synapse,

fire! Crime made by crime,
the blonde sits alone

in the bar, motionless.
"Aren't all women just waiting

for us?" he types into Reddit,
before closing the lid,

and going to bed, 
alone.
