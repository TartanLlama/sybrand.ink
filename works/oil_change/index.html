<p>Got my genderfluid changed today.</p>
<p>It was leaking out of my trouser leg,
leaving a smear of cat
hair, stardust, and chip
grease behind me.</p>
<p>The neighbours were starting to complain.</p>
<p>The chick at The Desk (between clucks):
Uh huh uh huh
our specials for today
are newts eyes
and the ability
to deliver puns
with a straight face
uh huh.</p>
<p>A very large beard barges past me
and demands to be served fear
and mountain water in a lager can.</p>
<p>Straightforward, I can respect that.</p>
<p>Again, face to wood with The Desk.
I pay for the newts eyes
before sitting down in the recliner
and drumming my fingers on the mixing barrel.</p>
<p>DON'T TOUCH THAT</p>
<p>The operator coming back from her break,
putting down her &quot;Adult Human
Female&quot; bag and spitting. I'm handed
a ticket on letter-headed paper
with a long hexadecimal number
at the bottom.</p>
<p>Wait your turn like everyone else.
Wait your turn like everyone else.
Wait your turn, like everyone else.</p>
<p>After a few years in the chair,
my number is up.</p>
<p>The newts eyes
(clearly rancid by this point,
but I don't want to fuss)
placed in the mixing barrel.</p>
<p>Standard item list.
Water? Check.
Guar gum? Check.
Acceptance?
Fresh out of that, love,
I'll throw in a couple more eyes instead.
E-numbers for that fresh glow?
No thanks,
they give me dysphoria.</p>
<p>Hit the button
Squelch
Crunch
Sizzle
Ping!
Needle the size of Belgium
Slurp
Flick, flick, flick
Mustn't forget to drain</p>
<p>the old stuff</p>
<p>Twist of kneecap
Cat hair, stardust,
screams,
chip grease, guar gum
Belgium
Screams
Pshhhhhhhhhhclunk screams
Thankyouseeyounexttimebye</p>
<p>Maybe I'll just switch to wearing skirts.</p>
